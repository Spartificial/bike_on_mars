## Background

The hypothetical colonization of Mars has received interest from public space agencies and private corporations, and has received extensive treatment in science fiction writing, film, and art. Reasons for colonizing Mars include curiosity, the potential for humans to provide more in-depth observational research than unmanned rovers, economic interest in its resources, and the possibility that the settlement of other planets could decrease the likelihood of human extinction. Thus for this purpose the first step is the explporation of the martian surface and many space agencies across the world have sent their rovers to mars for this purpose of exploration. Nasa's Perseverance rover is currently one of the best rovers to have been sent to Mars. But by Earth vehicle standards, the Perseverance rover is slow. By Martian vehicle standards, however, Perseverance is a standout performer. The rover has a top speed on flat, hard ground of 4.2-centimeters per second, or 152 meters per hour. This is a little less than 0.1-miles per hour. For comparison, a 3 mile-per-hour walking pace is 134 centimeters per second, or 4,828 meters per hour.

So our objective is to create a bike which is able to explore the Martian Surface faster and remains energy efficient.

##  Mars Environment Overview

1. SMALL PLANET: If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.
2. LONGER DAYS: One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.
3. RUGGED TERRAIN: Mars is a rocky planet. Its solid surface has been altered by volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.
4. ATMOSPHERE: Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2), argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2), and a small amount of oxygen and water vapor.
5. MANY MISSIONS: Several missions have visited this planet, from flybys and orbiters to rovers on the surface.The first true Mars mission success was the Mariner 4 flyby in 1965.
6. TOUGH PLACE FOR LIFE: At this time, Mars' surface cannot support life as we know it. Current missions are determining Mars' past and future potential for life.
7. RUSTY PLANET: Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.
